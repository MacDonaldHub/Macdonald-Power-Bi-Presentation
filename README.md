A task to harness the benefits of Power Bi as a tool for visualization
# Project Problem or Task:
Youâ€™re a Data Analyst working for an electronic tech company. You have been asked by your manager, to present the data on total cost, profit and the profit status of the company and you have been provided with data on sales from different products, product category, state and zones to understand and track the performance of company.
# Project Description:
To Analyze Data given to me in Excel format on Power Bi and relay my findings from the Data analayzed. The data collected was Electronic Sales - an XLSX file. My aim is to import the data into Power Bi load and transform teh data for the analysis. I achieved this using Microsoft Power Bi.
# Data Source:
The data source was from a Github repository link, as follows; https://github.com/Fabulousnani/Data-Developer-Bootcamp/blob/main/Electronic%20Sales.xlsx
# Project Design:
Below are the steps taken:
i. import the excel data document downloaded from https://github.com/Fabulousnani/Data-Developer-Bootcamp/blob/main/Electronic%20Sales.xlsx into Power Bi
ii. The columns visible are order id, order date, unit cost, unit price, order qty, channel, promotion name, product name, product subcategory, product category, state, zone, and sales - making a total of 13columns
in order to get my data table complete for proper analysis i added 3 extra columns - total cost, profit and profit status
to get the total cost i simply multiplied order qty by unit cost, to get the profit i simply subtracted total cost from sales and to get the profit status i simply used the condition statement we are familiar with on excel - if([Profit]<0,"Loss","Gain")
After that i proceeded to presenting the table on a visual report template in Power Bi
Using Filters tab, Visualization tab and Fields tab i was able to organize my data properly to the desired state i want
# Findings:![Power Bi Visual for Electronic Sales](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110080287/183376390-d10d511d-b15f-4206-b853-a3c2a2a4d074.png)
I discovered as is seen in the visual chart above, in the year 2012, in the south-south zone, Delta had the highest profit by state with a revenue of 0.43million and their profit by channel was showing store to be the highest - 0.92M i.e., 27.57%. There are so many other findings for each year, each state, each zone an so on. This can be seen from the Power Bi file which will be uploaded as well
# Recommendation:
I recommend this tool to any data analyst who wishes to visualize his data. Power Bi is awesome and easy to use. It makes visualization and data organization fun, easy and fast
# Conclusion:
I hope that my gradual but consistent steps to approaching the project task as a Data development Bootcamp Student is going to also inspire others to pick interest in learning this softskill. I hope to gain more knowledge in the data development world.
